# Static Single Assignment (SSA) Form (New!)

This language extension lets you represent Bril programs in [static single assignment (SSA)][ssa] form.
As in the standard definition, an SSA-form Bril program contains only one assignment per variable, globallyâ€”that is, variables within a function cannot be reassigned.

This extension (which you can call "ssa2") is a successor to an older [SSA extension][ssa1].
The new extension uses [Filip Pizlo's "Pizlo form," a.k.a. "phi/upsilon" form][pizlo].
In particular, it adds both a `phi` instruction for "receiving" data across control flow edges and a complementary `upsilon` instruction for "sending" data to `phi`s.

Operations
----------

Semantically, the instructions in this extension adds "shadow variables" to the state of the program.
Imagine a separate environment (a map from shadow variable names to ordinary values);
the `upsilon` instruction writes to shadow variables and `phi` reads from them.
Shadow variables obey a static single use (SSU) restriction, i.e., there may be only one `phi` in a function that reads from each shadow variable.

Here are the two main instructions in detail:

- `upsilon`:
  An effect instruction that takes two arguments: a destination and a source.
  The instruction copies a value from the source, a "regular" variable, to the destination, a shadow variable.
  For example, `upsilon x y` takes the value from the ordinary variable `y` and copies into the shadow variable `x`.
- `phi`:
  A value instruction with zero arguments.
  The instruction gets the value from the shadow variable named by the destination and copies it to the regular variable of the same name.
  So, for example, `x: int = phi` copies the value from the shadow variable `x` and puts it into the ordinary variable `x`.

When working with SSA form, it also turns out to be useful to explicitly propagate undefined values.
So there is one more instruction in this extension:

- `undef`:
  A value instruction with zero arguments.
  It sets the destination variable, which may be of any type, to a special *undef* value.
  The only thing you can do with this undef value is copy it to other variables with `id`, `upsilon`, and `phi`.
  It is an error to feed an undef value into any other operation at runtime.
  In other words, in well-formed programs, all `undef` instructions are transitively dead.

Examples
--------

Here's a simple example that uses `upsilon` and `phi` to copy something through a shadow variable:

    one: int = const 1;
    upsilon shadow one;
    shadow: int = phi;
    print shadow;

While `upsilon` and `phi` can appear anywhere in a program, the actual purpose is to put them around control flow edges.
Put `upsilon` at the end of one basic block and `phi` at the beginning of a successor block.
Here's a small example:

      a: int = const 5;
      upsilon c a;
      br cond .here .there;
    .here:
      b: int = const 7;
      upsilon c b;
    .there:
      c: int = phi;
      print c;

You can think of these two `upsilon` instructions as "sending" two different values to the `phi` instruction for `c`.
Because there is only one assignment to every variable, `phi`s are also globally unique:
that is, every function can have at most one `phi` for each variable.

The [reference interpreter](../tools/interp.md) supports programs in SSA form because it can faithfully execute `upsilon`, `phi`, and `undef`.
